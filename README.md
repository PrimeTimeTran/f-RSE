## Dependencies

- Fluter
- Bloc
- SyncFusion

## Getting Started

- Get a copy of `.env`
- Create a NOTES.md for saving code snippets and notes for yourself.
- Create a SCRATCHPAD.md for saving snippets while working which you don't necessarily want to keep "long term"

### Deployment

#### Web

- flutter build web
- flutter run -d chrome

## FAW

- Why isn't an asset in assets available on web?
  - Because we have to include them in web/assets & declare them in web/manifest.json for them to be bundled in the build process
